# SarahGraceDesigns 
One good thing about my pandemic boredom is my new found love for crocheting and crafting. This ecommerce website combines my love for crocheting and coding and showcases my favourite personal handmade designs.

The SarahGraceDesigns site allows users to browse, filter and sort all products. 
Users are able to view products, add them to their cart and eventually check out items. This site also includes functionality to create an account
to allow for saved carts, lists and faster checkout. All products, images and designs were personally created for this website.

## Design 
This website is desgned to be scalable with multiple new products, users and filters. For this reason, all images are stores on an Amazon S3 bucket, since it is efficient 
and cost effective. To allow for scalability and simplicity of the structured data, all product information is stored in a relation database (postgres)
